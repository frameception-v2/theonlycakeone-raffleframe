## Minimal Implementation Spec
Create a focused spec addressing the core user need.
We have an existing Farcaster miniapp (Frame v2) template to work with.
We need to customize the template in form and function to meet the user requirements.

### Output Format
1. Core Functionality
   - Main user flow
   - Required API endpoints
   - Key data structures

2. Implementation Approach
   - Frame structure (screens/actions)
   - External API integration points
   - State management approach

3. Technical Considerations
   - API authentication needs
   - Critical error scenarios

### API Context
None

### User Prompt
Create a raffle where people can register in. They need to be able to share the frame so more people can register
